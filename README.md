# Image-Super-Resolution-Using-Autoencoders-in-Keras
Image super-resolution (SR) is a classical problem in computer vision. Reconstructing a high-resolution photo-realistic image from its counterpart low-resolution image has been a long challenging task in the fraternity of computer vision. 

This task becomes even more difficult when all we have is a single low-resolution image as input to recreate its high-resolution image. Deep learning-powered autoencoder could significantly enhance the quality of images. That is, our neural network will create high-resolution images from low-res source images.
